My first game for my Video Game Design class

This game is a, 32-bit C++ Console Application.

---

To play the game, you first unzip the *myFirstGame.zip*. You'll see a *myFirstGame.exe* file inside the folder you extracted the **.zip* file. Double click on the *myFirstGame.exe*, and the console application should open up. To begin the game, you first type in your name, or an alias, Note: the name has to be one word. Then you can choose the difficulty you want to play on. After that a number will randomly generate, choosing which cup number the ball will be under. If you get it right, you win; if you don't get it right you loose. If you want to play again there is an option at the end for a restart. The game play is dynamic and doesn't take up to much memory in fact it doesn't take up more than 2 KiB. (I haven't measured out how much it takes up on the hardest of difficulties).

###Downloads


You can download a release any time you want...

---

###System Requirements

This program is only for **Windows XP/7/8/8.1** or **Linux** with the extension **Wine** (I haven't tested it on Linux yet).

---

I might add more to this game later; I might make a release that isn't console but instead a windows form application.

If you would like to see more features added to this game just make a ticket, and tag it as *feature*.
You may also fork this branch, or the master branch if you still can, but do not edit with this main respiratory.
