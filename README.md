My first game for my video game design class

This game is only a 32 bit C++ console application.

You first type in your name. Then you can choose the difficulty you want to play on. After that a number will randomly generate, choosing which cup number the ball will be under. If you get it right, you win; if you don't get it right you loose. If you want to play again there is an option at the end for a restart. The game play is dynamic and doesn't take up to much memory infact it doesn't take up more than 2 kb. (I haven't messured out how much it takes up on the hardest of difficulties.

You can download it when I have made a build for version #0.1

This program is only for windows or linux with the extension wine (I haven't tested it on linux yet).
