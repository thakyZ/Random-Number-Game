My first game for my Video Game Design class

This game is a, 32-bit C++ Console Application.

You first type in your name. Then you can choose the difficulty you want to play on. After that a number will randomly generate, choosing which cup number the ball will be under. If you get it right, you win; if you don't get it right you loose. If you want to play again there is an option at the end for a restart. The game play is dynamic and doesn't take up to much memory infact it doesn't take up more than 2 kb. (I haven't messured out how much it takes up on the hardest of difficulties.

You can download a release any time you want...

This program is only for Windows XP/7/8/8.1 or Linux with the extension Wine (I haven't tested it on linux yet).

I might add more to this game later; I might make a release that isn't console but instead a windows form application.

If you would like to see more features added to this game just make a ticket, and tag it as "feature".
